We are thrilled to announce that our recent work, *LucidDreamer: Towards High-Fidelity Text-to-3D Generation via Interval Score Matching*, has been selected as a spotlight paper at the prestigious CVPR 2024 conference. This recognition is a testament to the innovative breakthroughs the paper introduces in the field of generative models.

**LucidDreamer** has been designed to transform textual descriptions directly into high-quality 3D models, overcoming previous challenges that limited the detail and accuracy of generated 3D content. The key to our approach lies in a novel method named **Interval Score Matching (ISM)**, which ensures the generation of detailed, high-quality 3D models by effectively using pre-trained 2D diffusion models as a strong image prior.

### **Highlights of Our Work:**

- **Innovative Technique**: Our Interval Score Matching significantly enhances the text-to-3D generation process, allowing for the creation of photorealistic 3D models with unprecedented detail and fidelity.
- **Efficient and Effective**: Compared to existing methods, LucidDreamer reduces training costs and complexity while delivering superior results, as evidenced by extensive experiments and qualitative assessments.
- **Community and Industry Impact**: Since its feature as a daily paper on Hugging Face, our framework has attracted attention from both the academic community and industry practitioners, opening up new possibilities for creative and commercial applications.
